Apache::LogRegex - Parse a line from an Apache logfile into a hash

This document refers to version 1.5 of Apache::LogRegex, released November 20th 2008

Designed as a simple class to parse Apache log files. It will construct
a regex that will parse the given log file format and can then parse
lines from the log file line by line returning a hash of each line.

The field names of the hash are derived from the log file format. Thus
if the format is '%a %t \"%r\" %s %b %T \"%{Referer}i\" ...' then the
keys of the hash will be %a, %t, %r, %s, %b, %T and %{Referer}i.

Should these key names be unusable, as I guess they probably are, then
subclass and provide an override rename_this_name() method that can
rename the keys before they are added in the array of field names.

INSTALLATION

 % perl Makefile.PL
 % make
 % make test
 % sudo make install

TEST FAILURES

The tests are there to make sure that I have broken nothing when I
fiddle with the code and will teach you very little about how to use
the code. 

TO DO

Pretty much finished, unless there are some 'must have' features

BUGS

None so far

CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

V1.0:
      - First release to CPAN

V1.1
	  - Bug fix, can now handle \" as part of the %r element.
        Thanks to James March and mauke (from #perlhelp) for
        locating the bug and supplying the fix.

V1.2
	  - Bug fix. Because we allow \" in the %r element then we
		really should be allowing it in any of the Referer
		elements. Thanks to Damir Tresnjo for pointing this out.

V1.3
	  - Bug fix. Should allow for \" in the User-Agent. Thanks
		to Graeme J Sweeney for spotting this.

V1.4
      - Bug fix. Changed the regex so that it could parse DOS
        line endings when running on a Unix based system. Thanks
        to Christian Glahn for reporting this one and supplying
        the patch to fix it.
